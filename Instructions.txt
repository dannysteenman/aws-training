Instructions:

In your own AWS account, create an EC2 ssh key and save it somewhere.
Then do the following things. Try to fix the problems as though a student had created them manually while doing a lab (i.e. donâ€™t read the CloudFormation template).

1) Launch cfn_broken_lab_ssh.template, using your SSH key.
This creates four EC2 instances. You should be able to SSH into three
of them, and the other one should be running a web app. None of the four
instances is working.
Why not? Can you fix them in the console?

2) Launch cfn_broken_elb.template, using your SSH key.
This creates an ELB with a couple of EC2 instances running a web app,
but if you browse to the ELB, it doesn't work. Why not?
How can you fix it in the console?

3) Launch cfn_broken_webapp.template, and type a random string for the
S3 bucket name. This creates a webapp on a single EC2 instance.
The EC2 instance stores some data in a DynamoDB table called AWS-Services,
and stores static files in an S3 bucket called webapp-<yourS3name>.
Browsing to the EC2 instance on port 80 doesn't work. Why not?
How can you fix it in the console?

4) Delete the CloudFormation stacks. One of the stacks will fail to delete.
Why? How can you fix it in the console?

5) Bonus point for fixing the CloudFormation templates as well as
the running stacks ;-)
